# Terraria Clone (Chunk-Based Sandbox 2D)

A custom implementation of a 2D sandbox game heavily inspired by the mechanics of *Terraria*. Built from the ground up in Unity and .NET, this project focuses on high performance, strict modularity, and clean architectural patterns (SOLID principles).

The primary technical goal is to support a large, dynamic tile-based world with minimal CPU overhead and optimized RAM management.

## Key Technical Features

*   **Dynamic Chunk Management (`ChunkManager`):** The world is divided into grid-based chunks that load and unload dynamically in real-time based on the position of the watched object (the player). This prevents the GPU from being overloaded with the entire map render at once.
*   **Efficient Object Pooling (`ChunkPoolManager`):** Instead of costly `Instantiate` and `Destroy` operations during exploration, the engine fully recycles inactive chunk objects. Released sectors are pushed into a pool queue and immediately prepared for reuse, completely eliminating Garbage Collection spikes.
*   **Optimized Tilemap Rendering:** Drawing tiles inside each chunk is optimized using `SetTilesBlock`. The entire array of grid blocks is sent to the Unity native engine in a single batch call.
*   **Lightweight Save System (`SaveManager`):** World data is serialized directly into a raw binary format using C#'s `BinaryWriter` and `BinaryReader`. This results in microscopic `.map` file sizes and near-instant world loading times.
*   **Smart Camera Confiner:** A Cinemachine 2D Virtual Camera dynamically adjusts its physical boundaries using an automatically generated Polygon Collider 2D. This locks the camera view perfectly to the exact edges of the generated world array.

## Codebase Architecture

The project maintains highly decoupled layers of responsibility:
*   `WorldManager` – Central hub managing the global world state and dimensions.
*   `ChunkManager` – Responsible for grid coordinate mathematics and render distance filtering.
*   `ChunkPoolManager` – A dedicated object pool manager handling chunk lifecycle and recycling.
*   `SaveManager` – Independent I/O layer handling direct filesystem operations.
*   `WorldGenerator` – Independent generation layer utilizing Perlin Noise algorithms to construct the terrain grid.
*   `Chunk` / `TileData` / `WorldData` – Pure data models and rendering components representing blocks and map structure.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to separate root-level configuration files and external documentation from the core Unity engine assets:
*   `/Terraria clone project/` – The complete, clean Unity project directory (Source code, Assets, Packages, and Meta files).
*   The root folder contains version control configurations (`.gitignore`), project documentation, and core project assets.
